Made this website for an owner who runs restaurants to inform what kind of food they have

- **Spec:** Javascript, React, TailwindCSS, Firebase

- **Check App:** [Hungry?](https://katsuraba-kitchien.netlify.app/)

### Why made me create this app?

Achieved a client work from Japan as a freelance. I decided to use a straightforward design with Tailwind CSS so that they needed a website to spread the restaurant inoformation in public.

### What was challenging?

Understanding to use Tailwind CSS. Applying firebase to store the all restaurant data. It helps easily add and edit to update the restaurants information for people who unfamilliar with coding.
